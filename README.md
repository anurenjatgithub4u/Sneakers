# Sneakers Shopping App UI

Welcome to the Sneakers Shopping App UI repository! This Kotlin Jetpack Compose project aims to provide an engaging and user-friendly UI for a Sneakers Shopping App. Below, you'll find detailed information about each screen and the dependencies used.

Screens

Splash Screen
The Splash Screen is the first screen users see when launching the app. It includes a small animation that provides a visually appealing and smooth transition into the main app.

Home Screen
The Home Screen is the main landing page of the app. It showcases a carousel effect with featured sneakers, creating an eye-catching display of the latest trends. Below the carousel, users can browse a list of shoes and explore them further using expandable cards.

Category Screen
The Category Screen allows users to discover sneakers based on different categories. Each category is represented by an image of a sneaker, accompanied by a description to entice users into exploring further.

Search Screen
The Search Screen includes a text field that allows users to search for products. Though the functionality is a UI representation only, it provides a glimpse of how users can search for specific sneakers.

Product Screen
The Product Screen displays a list of shoes with their corresponding images. It fetches dummy data to populate the list, creating a visual representation of the various sneakers available in the app. The Coil library is used to load and display the images seamlessly.

Product Details Screen
The Product Details Screen provides in-depth information about a specific sneaker. It includes an enlarged view of the sneaker's image, allowing users to examine the details closely.
